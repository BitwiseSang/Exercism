# My Exercism Solutions 📝

This repository serves as a personal backup of my solutions to various exercises on [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org/) for the **Ruby** track.

Exercism is a platform that helps you improve your programming skills by providing coding challenges and offering expert code mentorship.

## Repository Structure 📂

My solutions are organized into a top-level `solutions` directory, with subdirectories for each language track and then individual folders for each exercise.

The typical structure looks like this:

```
├── solutions/
│   ├── language-track-name/
│   │   ├── exercise-name/
│   │   │   ├── my_solution_file.ext
│   |   .
|   |   .
|   |   .
```

For example, a solution for the "Lasagna" exercise in the Ruby track would be located at `solutions/ruby/lasagna/lasagna.rb`.

## My Goal and Progress 🚀

I'm using this repository to learn about Ruby through exercises. Feel free to explore my solutions, but please note that they represent my best effort at the time of completion and may not always be the most idiomatic or efficient way to solve a problem.<br>

**The primary goal is learning!**
